    # OPEN on the bedroom of COUNTESS BATTA S. DEVILA, a Villaness who lives in a comically- spooky castle on the edge of the kingdom. Despite the keep's looming exterior, what we can see of Batta's room is a bit of a hodgepodge of different styles and interests- from the billowing, dramatic Victorian curtains to an evil Lightning McQueen racecar bed in the center of the room.
    # This evening, Batta awakens from her evil slumber and begins preparing for the night ahead with the help of her trusty homemade vampiric thrall, DAISY-BOT.
